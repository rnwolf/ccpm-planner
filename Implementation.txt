# Critical Chain Simulator - Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document explains how the Python implementation relates to the original VBA Excel project, and provides guidance on setting up and using the application.

## Original VBA Project vs. Python Implementation

### Class Structure

The original VBA project consisted of:
- Excel worksheet classes (LOGS.cls, LOGS_AV.cls, LOGS_CCPM.cls, LOGS_FV_CHART.cls)
- A module with task management functions (marq_pr_suppression.bas)

In the Python implementation, we've reorganized this into a more object-oriented structure:

1. **Task Class**: Represents a project task with properties like ID, name, duration, resources, predecessors.
2. **ResourceManager Class**: Manages project resources.
3. **CriticalChainSimulator Class**: Core simulation engine, handling scheduling, critical chain identification, and buffer calculation.
4. **CCPMSimulatorGUI Class**: User interface using Tkinter.

### Core Functionality Mapping

| VBA Functionality | Python Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Excel worksheets (LOGS, GANTT) | Replaced with in-memory data structures |
| `remove_chains_first_task` | Implemented in `CriticalChainSimulator.remove_chains_first_task()` |
| `update_preds` | Implemented in `CriticalChainSimulator.update_preds()` |
| `max_fin_preds_reel` | Implemented in `CriticalChainSimulator.max_fin_preds_reel()` |
| GANTT diagram | Implemented using matplotlib in `generate_gantt_chart()` |
| Fever charts | Implemented using matplotlib in `generate_fever_chart()` |

### Enhanced Features

The Python implementation adds several enhancements:

1. **Interactive GUI**: Uses Tkinter for a more modern interface compared to Excel VBA forms.
2. **Resource Leveling**: More sophisticated algorithm for resolving resource conflicts.
3. **Network Analysis**: Uses NetworkX library for dependency analysis and critical path calculation.
4. **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib for more flexible and customizable charts.
5. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between business logic and presentation layer.

## Setting Up the Application

### Requirements

To run the Critical Chain Simulator, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, networkx, tkinter

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib networkx
```

Note: Tkinter is included in standard Python distributions but may need to be installed separately on some Linux systems.

### Running the Application

Execute the Python script to launch the application:

```bash
python ccpm_simulator.py
```

## Using the Application

### Task Management

1. **Add Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create a new project task.
   - Task ID: Unique identifier for the task
   - Name: Descriptive name
   - Duration: Time required to complete the task
   - Resources: Comma-separated list of resources needed
   - Predecessors: Comma-separated list of task IDs that must complete before this task can start
   - Completion: Current progress (0-100%)

2. **Edit Tasks**: Select a task and click "Edit Task" to modify its properties.

3. **Delete Tasks**: Select a task and click "Delete Task" to remove it from the project.

### Resource Management

1. **Add Resources**: Click "Add Resource" to create a new resource.
   - Resource ID: Unique identifier (e.g., "R1", "DEV1")
   - Name: Descriptive name
   - Availability: Percentage of time the resource is available (default 100%)

2. **Edit Resources**: Select a resource and click "Edit Resource" to modify its properties.

3. **Delete Resources**: Select a resource and click "Delete Resource" to remove it.

### Project Scheduling and Visualization

1. **Schedule Tasks**: Click "Schedule Tasks" to calculate the project schedule based on the current tasks and resources.
   - This will identify the critical chain
   - Calculate project buffer
   - Resolve resource conflicts
   - Update the Gantt chart

2. **Gantt Chart**: View and update the project Gantt chart showing the critical chain in red.

3. **Fever Chart**: Monitor buffer consumption as the project progresses.

## Advanced Features

### Critical Chain Calculation

The critical chain is calculated using these steps:

1. Create a directed graph of task dependencies
2. Perform topological sorting to determine processing order
3. Schedule tasks based on predecessor finish times
4. Apply resource leveling to resolve conflicts
5. Identify the longest path through the network, considering both dependencies and resource constraints
6. Add project buffer at the end of the critical chain

### Buffer Management

Project buffers are calculated as 50% of the critical chain duration (this is a simplified approach; you can modify the `_calculate_buffers()` method to implement more sophisticated buffer sizing algorithms).

### Resource Leveling

Resource conflicts are resolved by delaying tasks that would otherwise require a resource that's already in use. The algorithm prioritizes tasks based on their start times.

## Extending the Application

To extend this implementation:

1. **Add Feeding Buffers**: Modify `_calculate_buffers()` to add feeding buffers at the convergence points where non-critical chains join the critical chain.

2. **Export/Import**: Add functionality to save and load project data to/from files.

3. **Resource Calendars**: Enhance the ResourceManager to handle specific availability calendars.

4. **Task Cost Tracking**: Add cost attributes to tasks and resources for budget management.

5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more project performance metrics and visualizations.
